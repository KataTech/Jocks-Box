# NBA Analysis

Jocks' Box: My team's project for Rice Data Science Club's Fall 2020 DEEP (Data Exploration & Experiential Learning) Event. I collaborated with fellow Rice student Jason Gardner (mentor), Ankit Patel, Nathan Powell, Sanjay Rajaekhar, Luke Stancil on this initial project (my first ever exposure to the data science pipeline). Our objectives were to identify the possible factors that may contribute to the outcome of a NBA team's performance in a given year, the strength of these factors relative to one another, and the consistency of these factors over the years 2012 - 2018. As a result, we were able to construct a predictive model for NBA team win rates in any of the given season with an RMSE of ~6%. My specific contributions to the notebook include the linear modeling using Scikit-Leanr, construction of the dataframes for coefficients & actual vs. expected win rates, visualization, optimizing the function so that the results are clear to audience, and documenting the objectives as well as a majority of the conclusions. 

Going forward, I am looking forward to perform analysis related to player salaries and performances or other specific analysis revoling around the Houston Rockets! 

Please reach out to me if you have any suggestions for the projects listed!
