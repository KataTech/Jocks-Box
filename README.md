Analysis on NBA Statistics

Original Version: Jocks' Box originated as my team's project for Rice Data Science Club's Fall 2020 DEEP (Data Exploration & Experiential Learning) Event. The members and mentor for the team can be found within the notebook as well as the code and analysis themselves. This initial project focused on identifying the possible factors that may contribute to the outcome of a NBA team's performance in a given year, the strength of these factors relative to one another, and the consistency of these factors over the years 2012 - 2018.
